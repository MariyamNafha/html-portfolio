<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there!
  I am Naph, a Maldivian with a love for creativity, learning and giving back to the community. By day, I work full time and in my freet time I volunteer at the Diabetes Society of Maldives, where I help raise awareness and support those living with diabetes.
  Advocacy and community work are close to my heart, and I find fulfillment in making a difference.</p>

<p>One of my biggest passions is Singing- music has always been a soure of joy and self-expression for me. Whether is singing alone to my favorite songs, it is something that brings me to life.
  I also have a deep love for baking and cooking where I experiment with flavours, creating delicious treats and sharing them with friends and family.</p>

<p>Lately, Ive been diving into the world of web development, and it has completely captivated me. I love the challenge of coding, building websites, and bringing creative ideas to life through technology. Learning this skill has opened up a whole new world for me, and Im excited about the possibilities ahead</p>
